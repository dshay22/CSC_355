Hello to whoever is grading this I have out put for the code in three seperate places.

For the Grid: for the grids the output is displayed in the terminal for all five files seperated by new lines between each test case file

For the shell sort:
    The output is displayed in the files named shell_sort_output from 0 - 4 each with a different test case

For the Array/Merge sort:
    The output is displayed in the files named array_sort_output from 0 - 4 each with a different test case

For the outout files duplicates of the input where created. I dont know why I tried using different scanners, the same scanner, resetting the scanners, closing scanners, closing and opening files
But i could not get the duplication to stop. the array is sorted but the output displays twice the numbers as before. 

to build the project i used the .jason file.
Eveything calls the main class, which calls SortingTest, which then calls the individual sorting method classes.
